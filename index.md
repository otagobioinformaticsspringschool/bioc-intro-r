::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with tabular data and spreadsheets.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::




The very abridged content covered in the _intro-R_ portion of Otago Bioinformatics Spring School covers:

Skip data organisation with spread sheets

Sections from https://otagobioinformaticsspringschool.github.io/bioc-intro-r/20-r-rstudio.html

- What is R/Rstudio 
- knowing your way around RStudio
- interacting with R
- R packages loading packages, (mention install)
 

Sections from https://otagobioinformaticsspringschool.github.io/bioc-intro-r/23-starting-with-r.html

- creating objects
- comments
- functions and arguments
- vectors and data types - only c(), length(), class()


Sections from https://otagobioinformaticsspringschool.github.io/bioc-intro-r/25-starting-with-data.html

- presentation of gene expressoin data (but data will be predownladed to ~/obss_2024/intro-r/rnaseq.csv)
- brief introduction of []'s in the indexing and subsetting data frames
- stop at factors


skip episode on manipulating /analysing completely

Sections from https://otagobioinformaticsspringschool.github.io/bioc-intro-r/40-visualization.html

n.b again data will be ~/obss_2024/intro-r/rnaseq.csv

- do first histogram, skip next as it has pipes
- "building plots interatively" - rna_fc will be premade as ~/obss_2024/intro-r/rnaseq_fc.csv so read that in instead of using the code there
- go through the dot plots and stop at change to line plots
- if time talk/show themes using a dot plot example


The rest of the content is extremely worth looking at in your own time but is omitted purely due to time constraints and to give an overview prior to the R code in subsequent days.
